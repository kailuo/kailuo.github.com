My name is Kai LUO, indie developer of [LKMAKE](http://lkmake.com). This is my blog for random thoughts and topics.

I love building applications with code and pixels for iPhone, iPad, Mac and Web; I believe in beautiful and useful things with simplicity; I enjoy biketrials in parks and rocks with friends.

Ping me at twitter [@kailuo](http://twitter.com/kailuo) :)

原则上，感想吐槽类会使用中文，未来的技术讨论会坚持英文。

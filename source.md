> Think of all the power on this earth, the power of nature and human beings, the power of spirit, and speed, and determination, and then realize that of all these powers, none is more important then the power that resize  within the minds of our soul, the power to learn, to communicate, to imagine, to create, the power to be your best.

#####Peter Gabriel

#####来自《苹果往事》的一段话

> This is my favorite photo of Steve Jobs. Leaning forward to connect with his wife after his keynote presentation at the 2011 WWDC. You can almost feel the relief and accomplishment radiating from him.  

> When I see this photo, I see a man who bent every fiber of his will toward a goal so lofty, so seemingly unattainable that no one thought it was possible, and at the end of that race, with the task completed, he closed his eyes and rested.

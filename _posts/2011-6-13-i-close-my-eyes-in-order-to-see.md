title: I Close My Eyes In Order To See

---


**I CLOSE MY EYES IN ORDER TO SEE.**  

Sometimes this is the only way, I have no other choice you know.
  
  
Today she called me. Although I can feel her inside-out, I am quite sure there&#8217;s a big gap between us, at least for now there is.
   
 
The gap thing is a fact, no matter what we do, we know this. So the best to do for both of us is just dive into one&#8217;s top task and be focused. And at this point of view, closing eyes is the right choice, for the future, if there&#8217;s one.
   
 
She might be with other guys during this time, our time. I might be like this too&#8230; The thing is, if we could not stand at this moment, or if it did happens to one of us before we reach the ideal end, it is just right, it&#8217;s not our fault, it&#8217;s the fate.
   
 
I close my eyes in order to see, to see the future, if there&#8217;s one waiting for us.
   
 
She might not seeing this words, but she must understand. OK, I am a bit worried about this, I must admitted to myself. But in some other point of view, this is a must-believe thing, if we could make it finally.
   
 
So I write these words tonight, as a thought, saved to my clouds. Some day, maybe a month later, maybe a year later, maybe never, she could see&#8230;
  
    
Well, this is the interesting side of life which we people should enjoy, right?

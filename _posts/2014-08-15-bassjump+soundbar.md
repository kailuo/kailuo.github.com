I am a big fun of [BassJump](http://www.twelvesouth.com/product/bassjump-2-for-macbook) for a long time, it is truely the best 3rd party accessory I have ever bought for my MacBook Pro.

This year, I replaced my MBP with a grand new Mac Pro with a Dell display. For I always love a cleaner workspace, it is very hard to have some fancy giant speakers on the desktop... fortunately Dell has [an upgraded version](http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&s=gen&sku=318-2885) of SoundBar speakers that can be attached to the display which is a big space saver :)

But, low-end speakers are always terrible with bass sound, although the new SoundBar has a much more improved sound quality. So I started to think and wish if the BassJump could work with 3rd parties... and guess what, it did work!

I am running on OS X mavericks with their latest driver, and all you have to do is to choose the SoundBar instead of the built-in speakers in BassJump software settings, that's all. And for a better sound, you may need to use a custom sound settings: adjust the bass to 150Hz and louder the volume to about 90%, I just found that is amazing with the SoundBar.

p.s. The BassJump Sound System works great throughout the system, except one thing, Chrome browser has no sound.

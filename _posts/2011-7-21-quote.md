title: Quote of Robert Montgomery

---

I close my eyes and think of all the things I don't want. And visualize them rolling by, vacuum cleaners, 3D tvs, new phones and cars and hand bags, a neat house in the suburbs.

I think of how unhappy these things would make me and then I am free. If you don't want these things they can never have you. 

Then I think of wood and I think of my bones as wood, something slow and put here a long time ago.

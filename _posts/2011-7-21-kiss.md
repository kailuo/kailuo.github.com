title: Keep It Simple

---

First of all, when you design, solve things in the simplest way possible. Your goal should be simplicity, not "how can I apply a pattern to this problem."

Don't feel like you aren't a sophisicated developer if you don't use a pattern to solve a problem.

Other developers will appreciate and admire the simplicity of your design.

Than said, sometimes the best way to keep your design simple and flexible is to use a pattern.
